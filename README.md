The Gender Pay Gap Hack is a UK-based collaboration between the [AI Club for Gender Minorities](https://www.meetup.com/ai-club/), [codebar](https://codebar.io/), and [Ellpha Citizen](https://www.ellpha.com/) to use Data Science to discover new, actionable, and high-impact insights about the [UK's Gender Pay Gap Data](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download). Ultimately, this grassroots initiative aims to help address this inequality, and enable the achievement of gender parity across all socio-economic areas both locally and worldwide.


The UK government has a [beta service for searching the gender pay gap data](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/).
