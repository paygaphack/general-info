**Gender Pay Gap Hack is dedicated to creating a welcoming, respectful, safe and harassment-free hack experience for everyone. We value and promote the inherent worth of every person and group; foster dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embrace diversity.**

Gender Pay Gap Hack Day values and promotes the inherent worth of every person and group; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity. When you attend the pay gap hack, you are also making a commitment to these principles.
We invite you to help make the hack day and associated environments places that are welcoming and respectful to all participants, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin, ethnicity, political affiliation, or religion. We gain strength from diversity and welcome new ideas in a complex field by fostering collaboration among groups with different interests, needs, and skills.  By creating an inclusive environment, we can focus on our program and do great work together.

**What is Harassment?**

We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form, in person or online, including but not limited to:
* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to protected characteristics such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and/or religion
* Verbal threats or demands
* Sexualised, discriminatory, and/or exploitive images in any conference space, including presentations, sponsor exhibits, or public areas
* Physical or verbal micro-aggressions
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any harassing behaviors
* Slights and negative messages based on appearance

**Enforcement**

By participating in the gender pay gap hack, all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers commit to following this code of conduct at the hack day, events leading up to the hack itself, social events at off-site locations, as well as in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone violating this code of conduct will have appropriate proportionate action taken against them, such as being expelled from the hack day, related events or online communities, at the discretion of the organizers.

**Reporting**

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or experience or witness any violation of this code of conduct, please contact the organisers immediately.  You may ask a volunteer to find them for you. You can also email us at genderpaygaphack2018@gmail.com.
