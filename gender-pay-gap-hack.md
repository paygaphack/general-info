# Mind the `#GenderPayGap`

On 22 and 23 June, Ellpha Citizen, codebar & the AI Club for Gender Minorities are coming together to accelerate equal pay with the power of data science!

- Using the UK’s Gender Pay Gap Data in combination with other open data sets, we can create new insights about what leads to the #genderpaygap.
- We need help from brilliant minds in #datascience who share our passion for equality in the workplace. With your help, we can create & amplify new insights to change the world faster!
- Join us on 22 June (evening) & 23 June (all day) at BuzzFeed's London office in Regent Street to #pushforequalpay.

## The opportunity

Our idea is simple: identify correlations between the government’s open Gender Pay Gap data and other sources of open data like financial performance, country of ownership, gender composition on the board of directors, and information on talent management, to name a few.

Through the power of data science, we aim to surface new facts and insights which will enable us to take informed action. We will publicise and amplify our learnings to help create better action plans to close the #genderpaygap.

## We cannot do this alone

We are seeking a diverse mix of data skills. Specifically we’ll be focusing on these five areas:

- Data visualisation
- Statistical modelling/Econometrics
- Interactive tooling (apps, dashboards, widgets)
- NLP/text machine learning (on English-language public documents published by companies/media...)
- Technical review & translation of existing media published pay gap analysis e.g. for non-technical audiences

If you’ve got capabilities in these areas & you would like to contribute to accelerating Gender Pay Equality, please join us!

**Submit this form no later than 1 June: [Apply](https://goo.gl/forms/lZQ5Q5BLPgbjb9RR2)**

You'll hear back from us the following week.
